## Overview

The animatronics briefcase is a part of my ongoing clown performance. The breifcase is controlled remotely via a controller by somebody else while I perform improvisation with it in front of a live audience.

## Build Highlights

- It is a standard briefcase with custom mechanism built inside.
- There are two locks on the sides and these are controlled by a pair of servos.
- The lid is open and closed by 2 servo as well.
- The last mechanism is a little cannon that shoots shredded paper like it ate it.
